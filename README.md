TXcounties
==========

TXCourtsOfAppeals.json should show, for each Texas appellate judicial district, every time a statute changed the configuration of counties within that district, the statute citation, the list of counties, and the effective date. It should be mostly correct.

In addition to the 254 extant Texas counties, the dataset mentions four defunct counties: Buchel, Encinal, Foley, and Greer.

TXCountiesDistricts.json is GeoJSON of Texas counties with tags showing membership in judicial districts (district and appellate courts). Intended for making data visualisations. Not ready to use.
