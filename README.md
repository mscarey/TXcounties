TXdistricts
==========

TXCourtsOfAppeals.json should show, for each Texas appellate judicial district, every time a statute changed the configuration of counties within that district, the statute citation, the list of counties, and the effective date. It should be mostly correct. In addition to the 254 extant Texas counties, the dataset mentions four defunct counties: Buchel, Encinal, Foley, and Greer.

TXHistoricalCounties.geojson is data from the [Atlas of Historical County Boundaries](http://publications.newberry.org/ahcbp/downloads/states.html) converted to GeoJSON. Boundaries which were outdated by 1892-08-15 are excluded.

TXCountiesDistricts.json is also GeoJSON, but it combines map data with district membership in the same file. It's the only file here that includes trial-level judicial districts. It's incomplete.
